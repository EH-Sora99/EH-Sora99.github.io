Pages to be added here: Home, About Me, My projects & Working on, My Skill Set, Where to find me

The landing page text will be added here: Hi there! And I goes by EH-Sora online. I'm a semi self-taught programmer and web developer. I love to learn new things and share my knowledge with others. I also love to create new projects and work on them. I hope you enjoy my blog!
This GitHub Page/Blog is something I made just for fun and a bit of a learning experience and doucument my work, as well as a bit of a portfolio for my projects.

I live in Sweden and English is not my first language, so please forgive any mistakes I make.
I picked up HTMl and CSS just because I felt like it and will pick up more web development skills as I go along (and my enternal headach named JavaScript).

I hope you all enjoy my blog and find my confused work!
