</br>Hi there! And welcome to my GitHub Page/Blog.
I mainly going by EH-Sora online (with some variation of it) and the point of this project is to pickup more web development, as well some more general use knowledge in different programing languages.

To start of I have dyslexia and I'm Swedish, but speaking English almost fluently.
But due to English not being my native language and my dyslexia mess up at times and things might not make sense at times, so please be patient with me.

How this GitHub Page/Blog will work is mainly a learning experience in web development and as well a bit of a portfolio to show what I can do.
As well build up my knowledge in programing.

How things will usually going to work for this GitHub Page/Blog project is you will see my progress as I go and get some work done on the side when I have time and energy for it.

But with that said I hope you all will enjoy this mess of a project and follow my cuatic learning process.
