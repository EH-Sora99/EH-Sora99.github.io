YouTube: YouTube is the platform I mainly upload too and have been making videos on and off since 2016.

Bluesky: Bluesky is the main platform to follow what's going on in the background and to get updated what's going on with a video.

GitHub: I'm trying to use GitHub much more and as well forcing myself to be more neatly orgnazed with the project files and have proper version control to be second nature.

Mastodon: I'm really bad at using Mastodon, but I will try to use it more.
