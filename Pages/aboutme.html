Hi I'm EH-Sora and I'm really bad at talking about myself, but here we go.

I'm Swedish and live in northern Sweden, I studied game design in high school, so my knowledge in C# and Unity is quite outdated.

I'm semi self-taught with web development and in programing (with help YouTube tutorials and Google).

I'm basically learning web development and as well a lot of different programing languages (like COBOL) just because I feel like it.

I'm quite dense and stubborn at times and giving myself a headache before giving up on something.

I have ADHD and dyslexia, as well some undiagnosed insomnia, depression and anxiety.

I prefer using Macs and macOS for my creative work flow, mainly due to using Macs and macOS for like a decade.
But I use a mix of macOS and Linux for my daily use and have a lot of laptops around me (mainly MacBook Pros) and when I need to test something I usually prefer running on bear metal.

But I think this pretty much describe me in general, I will change and shuffle things around as I go and lean.
